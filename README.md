Advanced Financial Analysis &amp; Risk Assessment of Listed Companies (FinSharpe Project)

This project, developed for FinSharpe, a SEBI registered investment advisor, embarks on a strategic endeavor to dissect and analyze financial data, aiming to unearth investment gems with the most attractive risk-reward balances. Utilizing Python and Pandas, it meticulously sifts through datasets, applying rigorous filters such as company scale, drawdowns, financial slopes, and debt ratios, alongside a proprietary FinSharpe score. This analysis is not just about pinpointing opportunities but also a deep dive into risk assessment, leveraging volatility, beta, and drawdown metrics to spotlight high-risk investments. This project exemplifies the synergy of data science and financial analysis, demonstrating how computational tools can significantly enhance investment decision-making.
